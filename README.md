# OSI Prediction

This project is based on Online Shopperes Purchacing Intention. The data set is available in both kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repo. If you want to try out the model click [here](https://onlineshopperitention.herokuapp.com/) (CURRENTLY NOT AVIALBLE). I have used heroku plattform and also flask framework for the deployment of the model.  I have carried out almost all the process of a Data Science Project. I have explained it deeply (how I carried out) in a blog. The code and the project is explained in the blog.
